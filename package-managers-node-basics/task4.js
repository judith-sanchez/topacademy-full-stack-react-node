// Task 4
// When developing CSS code, you can define colors in many different ways. The two most common are using hexadecimal codes, like #FFAA21, and RGB format, like rgb(255,170,33)

// Create a NodeJS project with a proper package.json file

// Create a function that converts RGB to Hex and another that converts Hex to RGB

// Now export them as a package and publish them on NPM

// You should be able to reuse your library in a different project
