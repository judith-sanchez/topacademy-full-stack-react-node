// https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all

// Task 2
// 🗓️ Due by Thursday

// This should be the last exercise. Make sure you know async javascript and REST APIs :grinning:

// Query this API https://restcountries.com/v3.1 to build a countries list.

// Find out how to use the API

// Create a page where you fetch all the countries

// Create a list displaying every country

// The countries should be displayed as cards containing at least the name, the flag, and the languages spoken in that country. You can customize adding more data if you want.

// Create a text input to filter the countries by name

// When the user types something in this text input, you should dynamically update the countries list, filtering the countries that include that string in its English name
