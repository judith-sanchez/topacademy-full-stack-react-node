// Task 1 -- WATCH VIDEO

// Create a new HTML page with the following body:

// <button type="button">Start timer (0/3)</button>
// <div id="timers"></div>
// Write a JavaScript function startTimer that takes the number of seconds as a parameter and:

// Returns a Promise that resolves itself after the specified value.

// The promise resolves with a string similar to 'Done in 6 seconds!'.

// Create the JavaScript code for the following requirements:

// Every time the button is pressed, a new timer must be started using the function defined above, with a random duration between 2 and 9 seconds (it must be an integer value, including 2 and 9).

// The label of the button must reflect at all times the number of timers currently running:
// Start Timer (0/3), or Start Timer (1/3), etc.

// If 3 timers are running, the button must become disabled until at least one timer stops.

// When there are less than 3 timers running, the button must be enabled.

// When a timer finishes:

// Add a new div to the #timers element, displaying the text returned by the Promise
// e.g. Done in 6 seconds!

// Update the button to reflect the number of timers still running.

// Use your creativity to add nice styling to the application.

// You can use the following recording as a reference for the main functionality.
