// Task 5
// Create the JS game Guess the Magic Number:

// Generate a random number between 1 and 100 when the page loads;

// Use prompt to read input from the user;

// Use alert to display messages in the browser;

// The user has 7 tries to guess the magic number - every time they enter a value:

// Keep track of the number of tries;

// If the guess is correct, the game ends and the user sees the message You won in <value> tries!;

// If the guess is incorrect:

// Display a message informing the user that the magic number is greater or lesser than the number just entered - The magic number is greater than <entered number>! You have <value> tries left.

// Then allow the user to enter a new value;

// If the value entered is not a number, take away one try and show them a message with how many tries they have left;

// If the user didnâ€™t guess the correct number in 7 tries:

// The game ends;

// The message You lost! The magic number was <value> will be displayed.

// The user can replay by reloading the page.

// Create an HTML page and run the JS code.
